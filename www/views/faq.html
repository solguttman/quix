                <p>
                    Quix is the future of plumbing. It’s a
                    revolutionary new app that lets you upload
                    a picture of the problem and schedule a
                    time for a plumber to come at your
                    convenience
                </p>
                <div class="flow-text cyan-text text-lighten-2 italic"><em>Who uses Quix?</em></div>
                <p>
                    Everyone! If you want your plumbing
                    problem fixed quickly and reliably, get Quix.
                </p>
                <div class="flow-text cyan-text text-lighten-2 italic"><em>Which locations does Quix Service?</em></div>
                <p>
                    Currently, Quix services Brooklyn and it’s
                    surrounding areas. Quix is working on
                    expanding to serve the entire Tri-State Area,
                    then all of NY and eventually to all States.

                <p>
                    No more hunting for phone numbers and
                    then waiting around all day for a plumber
                    who doesn’t show up. No more having
                    plumbing problems drag on while you wait
                    for parts to be shipped. Instead, with the
                    app you can upload a picture of the
                    problem, so the plumber knows what to
                    bring with him. He will come on time, and
                    quickly fix the problem.
